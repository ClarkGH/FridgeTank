Grocery List Application Evolved

Have you ever wanted to make a specific recipe, end up buying all of the ingredients, and then wonder "What else can I make with what I've got?"

"TBN" will help create a grocery list based on the recipes you want to create as well as connect you to other recipes associated with those ingredients.

Stretch Goals
===
1. Linking to an application where you can purchase ingredient. (Apps like instacart)

2. Setting a budget and working within that budget.

3. Giving more variety based on the ingredients ( want to make ranch eggs, get other egg based recipes using similar ingredients)

4.
